Project Omega: Void Handshake
A security-focused terminal interface designed for secure string manipulation via vector-based encryption (ExecuteSiphon).
Fixes included:
* CSP Headers: Configured in vercel.json to allow Tailwind's JIT compiler (unsafe-eval).
* Logo 404: Replaced remote GitHub dependency with local omega_logo.svg.
* Responsive HUD: Optimized for mobile and desktop viewing.
Deployment
This project is ready for Vercel. Ensure index.html, vercel.json, and omega_logo.svg are in the root directory.
